<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">
As a .NET Backend Developer, I specialize in creating scalable, efficient systems designed to solve complex, real-world challenges. My technical expertise spans object-oriented programming (OOP), databases, data structures, algorithms, and front-end technologies like HTML and CSS. I have hands-on experience working with APIs, MVC architecture, LINQ, and Entity Framework, which I use to craft secure and high-performance backend solutions.

At Delta University, I am dedicated to continually expanding my technical skills and applying my knowledge to address real-world challenges. I thrive in collaborative environments where problem-solving is essential, and I enjoy taking on projects that push the boundaries of backend development. One project that particularly challenged me involved redesigning a legacy system, which deepened my understanding of performance optimization and user needs.

Looking ahead, I aim to contribute to innovative projects that drive business success and further refine my skills in building robust architectures that enhance user experiences.
